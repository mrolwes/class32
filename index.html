    <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:white;"><h3>Maps</h3><p>I used the Google Map API to get a map of Yellowstone, and tried to use radial buttons to pull up three different maps, but couldn't access more than one map from the source. Mapbe I need more than one API code. </p><p>I found an attr() example where the image changed, so I tried to make an image change to the map. It doesn't work, but I wish it did. If you have time to explain what I need to do, I would appreciate it.</p></div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:white;"><h3>Numbers & Strings</h3><p>I started by referring to Dave's code from the Number Form, and quickly realized how little I know about JQuery. I went two different routes. I tried basic Javascript, and then dug into the JQuery resources, but got no where. I recognize the pieces, but can't figure out how to put them together. I created a function ProcessText and tried to follow the pattern of ProcessNumbers, using a concat(), but didn't quite get it.</p> <p>Once again, I'm looking forward to the explanation, which helps. I still don't understand Javascript well enough to know what the JQuery is replacing.</p></div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:white;"><h3>Object List</h3> <p>I didn't even turn it in. I spent hours trying to figure out how to make the form appear and the table disappear and gave up. There was also a time constraint this week. Again, the code is copied from Dave's code.</p></div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:white;"><h3>Number Form</h3> <p>The Number Form code is copied and pasted from Dave's sheet. I could get the HTML, but the coding was a total loss to me. </p></div>
